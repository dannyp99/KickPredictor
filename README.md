# KickPredictor

Have you ever came up with an idea that you wanted to crowd fund? With our app, you can give us some small data on your kick starter project and we can tell you the likelihood of its success.

All required libraries are in the `requirements.txt` file to install them run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
To start the flask server, go to the base dir `KickPredictor/` and run `python3 app.py`.

To start the application be sure to enter the `ReactApp/` directory and run `npm i` or `npm install`. Then you can run `npm start` to start the react server.
